# Boyfriend Apology Project

This project is designed to create a simple web page that helps in apologizing to a girlfriend. It provides two options for the user: "Forgive" and "Do Not Forgive". The goal is to create a light-hearted and engaging experience for users looking to mend their relationship.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main file of the webpage, containing the structure and content of the page, including the "Forgive" and "Do Not Forgive" options.
- **css/style.css**: This file contains the style definitions for the webpage, setting the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual effects.
- **js/script.js**: This file includes the interactive logic of the webpage, handling the user's actions when they click on the "Forgive" or "Do Not Forgive" options.
- **assets/fonts/font.woff2**: A font file used to apply specific font styles in the webpage.
- **README.md**: This documentation file provides an overview of the project, instructions for use, and other relevant information.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the apology page.
2. Click on the "Forgive" button to display a message of reconciliation.
3. Click on the "Do Not Forgive" button to show a humorous response.
